The best Grill Cheese Recipe I've ever made.

Pre-proccess

Take 2 slices of bread
Take 2 slices of cheese (gooy finish use American Cheese or processed cheese if you don't live in America.If you want regular healthy Cheese just use Mozzarella and Cheddar Cheese.)
Cooking

Take a small pan and leave it on medium heat for 2-3 minutes
Put one piece of bread on the pan
Quickly put your choice or choices of cheese on the bread
Finish it with the last piece of bread
After about 2-3 minutes flip it
Then after its brown take it out and put it in a plate
Put some parsley flakes on top to make it more appetizing (Don't need to do this if you are in a rush)
And enjoy
